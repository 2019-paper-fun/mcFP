# motion-corrected-Fourier-ptychography
We propose a novel FP reconstruction method, termed motion-corrected Fourier ptychography (mcFP), to efficiently correct for unknown sample motion. This is crucial for applying the FP scheme to high-resolution endoscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Experimental results show that mcFP can correct for unknown sample motion with its standard deviation being up to 10% of the field-of-view scale.
